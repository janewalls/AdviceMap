# AdviceMap
AdviceMap is a personal project to build an interactive, location-based map of advice from recent travels. The idea is to collect helpful guidanceâ€”ranging from personal tips, to recommendations, to broader advice I received from locals - and display it based on where itâ€™s most relevant.

ðŸš€ Ideas for future developements
- A structured database of advice linked to geographic locations
- A public-facing website where users can explore and search the map
Categorization and tagging for better filtering and discovery
